descirption:
i want to take a pattern and search for that pattern specifically in the prompt the user enters

input:
pattern: string (last command line argument)

output format:
prints the line that contains that pattern immediatly after the user hitting enter 

steps:
-read the pattern from the command line args
-detect whether the optional argument was provided or not
-set the approriate flags accordingly
-read line from stdin
-if invert flag is set:
 -if line does not contain pattern:
  -if line no flag is set:
    -print line no
  -print line
-else:
 -if line contains pattern:
  -if line no flag is set:
   -print line no
  -print line
